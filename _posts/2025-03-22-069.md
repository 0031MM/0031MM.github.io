### There are two key elements that define Kramer Consulting’s visual identity: red and blue.  

These signature colors — also the founder’s favorites — perfectly capture the spirit of the brand: passion and professionalism.  

Building on these colors the logo design achieves a balanced geometric form. The overlay creates harmony between shape and meaning, resulting in a symbol that feels both distinctive and deeply personal.
