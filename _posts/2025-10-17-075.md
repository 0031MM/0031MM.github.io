### This website makes me really proud as I understand how it's made. 

Accessibility of vibe coding made me really want to dig into the topic as I prefer to have total control over every little aspect of design.

This simple setup made this real. I also realize how much has changed since 2005, when I was learning it for the first time. Everything is dynamic, file updates on the server are super fast and I also know English these days which helps a lot as well.
