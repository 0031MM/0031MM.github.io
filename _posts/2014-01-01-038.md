### Production hall with offices and zone for visitors that makes a good impression.  

Marsala runs on modularity and its form was aligned for optimized logistic flow. For maximal efficiency the same propotional module was applied in the whole building, so the facade can be made as repetitive as possible. The playfulness of the representative part is made with rotation of the same panel.

Marsala its also 2014's Pantone Color of the Year.
