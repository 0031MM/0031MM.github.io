Hello, I'm Martyna Maciaszek. 31MM is my life-long project nickname showing my professional growth and evolving interests. 

As a licensed architect I work on diverse projects - from furniture, interiors and buildings to urban-scale vision plans. Besides that I found myself willing to dig into coding, data visualisation and publishing. 

Since 2011 I have collaborated on diverse projects across the world, building my skills in renowned architectural offices throughout Europe.

With a career rooted in innovative design and a global perspective I published first version of this website in 2021 to share my thoughts and bring my vision to life.

I built this website in Visual Studio Code & Jekyll and hosted in Github Pages.
